## [Beer Lab](https://beer-lab.herokuapp.com)
#### A repository for storing, sharing, and discovering great homebrew recipes.
---

### Overview
Beer Lab is a simple CRUD application allowing users to store, share, and discover recipes for home brewing. 

When new recipes are added, quantities are converted to non-specific units (eg grams/Litre) and saved as a 'master copy'. When a user adds a copy of any recipe to their collection they can then adjust the total batch size and individual ingredient weights will be calculated automatically.

Users should be able to browse all submitted recipes with various filtering options, leave comments on recipes, and 'star' their favourites.
